First year of law school is considered the most intense year of any field with law books overload and boring law books at that. Toon In: Law School gives students a resource to study one of the four required classes to become an attorney by having access to humorous illustrations and relatable examples. Also, there is a advice board for law students to seek inspiration as well as a quiz for each chapter, labeled as "easy", "medium", and hard. 

I created this app after completing my certification in paralegal studies at Montclair State University. I had a few friends who were going to law school and even though the light at the end of the tunnel is very bright when it comes to their illustrious careers...they were suffering through the work overload and needed a place to escape with fellow first year law students and I think this would help them not only relieve tension but make learning law an easier experience for them.
