# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

Toon In: Legal Toons is an open social website for law students. Its foundation is Ruby On Rails with also substantial amounts of Javascript.

The main gem that is used is 'Devise' which is focuses solely on the Activ Admin feature. Active Admin...which is username and password based...allows me to add "Lawyers" and enables me to delete "Advice" that has been flagged. Active Admin is very elegant layout design that lets me see all what's flagged and deletes it, too.

Users will get the four core courses in law school. Only Tort Law is complete. User clicks on it and is taken a different page with its chapters. Only three chapters were used and its set to only three terms. There is a slideshow (used with Javascript) that shows a picture with the definition and story for each one. A question will appear beside each chapter and when the user clicks he will get the information about that chapter in modal form, which disappears onleave. 

There are two navigation links...Home and About...clicking on About gets you a modal with the information about the site and it goes away once onleave. 

Each course will have its own quiz. A user will get options of a timed quiz going from easy, medium to hard. After getting the quiz it will disappear after the allotted time. This is done using javascript.

Another page to Toon In is the Words of Wisdom which provides law students a gateway to positive advice and stories to keep them afloat while they go through the vigors of law school. It's open so anyone can speak up regarding what to say. I wish I could have made it specific to just law students.

Lastly, users can see a list of lawyers which is Ruby on Rails based. Only the administrator can add lawyers and also add avatars to each lawyer.

I was able to create an administrator by going through the Terminal...Admin.create(added parameters).
