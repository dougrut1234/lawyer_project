 <p id="caption_title">COMMON LAW</p>
  <%=image_tag "1.1.jpg", id: "default" %>
   <p id="caption_definition">Common law is unwritten law that originated hundreds of years ago, going all the way back to England, where it then settled here in the states. A long time ago, kings were able to make up laws. Fortunately, laws change over time, and we don’t have kings in the United States anymore.</p>
   <p id="caption_story">“Look at England and its kings as a school principal. They originate the laws and rules of what goes for the kids. They have the appropriate authority to expel when a child acts up.”</p>

<div class="w3-display-container mySlides">
<p id="caption_title">STATUTORY LAW</p>
 <%=image_tag "1.2.jpg", id: "default" %>
    <p id="caption_definition">Unlike common law, statutory law is written law that has been codified.
	This Public Policy is established by our legislators.</p>
   <p id="caption_story">“Now instead of looking at England and kings, we will look at politicians and judges as the teachers. Before the school year starts, they set up classroom rules and hand out a grading policy in which they themselves have established."</p>

<div class="w3-display-container mySlides">
    <p id="caption_title1">PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE</p>
      <%=image_tag "1.3.jpg", id: "default" %>
    <p id="caption_definition">One of the standards of proof in civil/tort law used in a court of law.
	It means “more probable than not” or “more true than not true” (51% true vs. 49% not true).</p>
   <p id="caption_story">“Someone broke the cookie jar! Andy and his daughter Abigail are present at the scene of the crime. Abigail loves cookies and was told not to have any. Andy has crumbs around his mouth but does that mean he tried to reach for the cookie jar like Abigail would? Though it’s not clear -cut, but looking at the evidence, it’s more likely true Andy accidentally broke the cookie jar."</p>
